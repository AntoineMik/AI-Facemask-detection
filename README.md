# Facemask detection using `Convolutional Neural Network` in `Python`

The `facemask lite` dataset on `Kaggle` contains `GAN-2` generated images of people with masks and without masks. Using that dataset, we trained a `Convolutional Neural Network` (CNN) to detect when someone is wearing a mask.
<br>
Target: Computer Vision  
Features: Face with a mask, Face without a mask
<br>

<br>
<br>
We start by loading and preparing the dataset; then, we visualize the distribution of the images in the dataset.
<br> 
Next, we `build` the CNN model, `train` the model, then `evaluate` it.
<br> 
Finally, we apply the model to `predict` whether someone is wearing a mask or not.
