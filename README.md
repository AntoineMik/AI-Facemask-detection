# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python

Welcome to the Face Mask Detection project, where we leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect whether someone is wearing a face mask. This project primarily focuses on computer vision and utilizes the Face Mask Lite dataset available on Kaggle, which contains GAN-2 generated images of people both with masks and without masks.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: We use the [Face Mask Lite dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prasoonkottarathil/face-mask-lite-dataset), which provides a diverse set of images for training and evaluation.

- **Objective**: Our goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between two classes: faces with masks and faces without masks.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: We start by loading and preparing the dataset, ensuring that the data is ready for training and evaluation.

2. **Data Visualization**: We visualize the distribution of images within the dataset, gaining insights into the balance between mask-wearing and non-mask-wearing images.

3. **Model Building**: We construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model tailored for this specific task. The model architecture is designed to efficiently handle image data and recognize face mask patterns.

4. **Model Training**: We train the CNN model using the prepared dataset, with a focus on achieving high accuracy in detecting face masks.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We assess the model's performance by evaluating its ability to correctly classify images as either "Face with Mask" or "Face without Mask."

6. **Prediction**: We demonstrate how to use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images, enabling real-time face mask detection.
